Overview
Welcome to the HairCare AI App project! This app uses a GPT vision model fine-tuned by us to analyze user-uploaded photos of their hair. By leveraging cutting-edge AI, the app provides personalized recommendations to improve hair health and suggests hairstyles that suit the user best.

Features
AI Hair Analysis: Upload a photo of your hair, and our AI analyzes its condition, identifying damage, dryness, or split ends.
Personalized Recommendations: Receive a tailored plan for healthier hair, including product recommendations and care routines.
Hairstyle Suggestions: Get AI-curated hairstyle ideas that complement your hair type and condition.
Current Status
The app was initially submitted to the App Store but was rejected due to some minor bugs. We are currently fixing these issues to ensure the app meets all guidelines and delivers a seamless user experience.

Key Fixes in Progress:
Resolving UI/UX bugs for smoother navigation.
Addressing compliance issues raised during the App Store review.
Improving performance and compatibility across devices.
Next Steps
Once the bugs are resolved, we will resubmit the app to the App Store for approval. Stay tuned for updates as we work to bring the HairCare AI App to your devices!
